You need to expand and rephrase the provided description for image generation to make the best image, by maximizing the image score:

* Overal score: how well the full description matches the generated image.
* Word scores: how well individual key tokens (objects, attributes, relations) from the description align with the image.

Current Description:

{init_description}

Here are some example rephrases and the corresponding image scores and the token level and relevant image scores: 

{descriptions}

Generate additional just 50 new descriptions that aim to maximize both the overall and token-level scores. Your goal is to produce substantive rewrites that increase the score of previously weak tokens and maximize the overall sore, while reusing the high-scored tokens from other examples in new and effective ways. Put each description in a different line, with a counter at the beginning (e.g. "1. 2. ..."), and keep them short (less than 77 words).
